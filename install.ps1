# Van Damme-o-Matic — Windows installer
#
# Run from a normal PowerShell window (no admin needed):
#
#     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
#
# What this does differently from install.sh, and why:
#
#   * Credentials. On macOS Claude Code keeps them in the Keychain; on Windows
#     it keeps them in %USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json. platform.mjs
#     handles both, so nothing here has to.
#   * Auto-start. There is no ~/.zshrc to append to. A logon scheduled task
#     starts the dashboard, and ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL is set as a persistent user
#     environment variable so every future terminal inherits it.
#   * The `vdm` CLI is bash. Git for Windows ships bash, so a small .cmd shim
#     forwards to it. Everything else is Node, which is required anyway.
